Thank you for downloading my pack of all Tomb Raider Remastered Textures Pack made by JoshDun. 

Please do leave a rating and a review (point out some mistakes if you find any in review, i will fix it).

All textures are from files of steam version of TRI-III Remastered (thanks Shadoofus for providing the files). 

Every texture sheet is in PNG file, roughly sorted by me (some mistakes might be present).

All textures are resized to 256x256 format Tomb Engine uses. 

Some textures might be missing due to files not being present (or didnt convert).

Some textures are not possible due to 1 block using stacking textures at the same time which is not possible in Tomb Engine.

Tomb Raider II Golden Mask expansion is all in one texture sheet, i wasnt sure which texture is from which level so i decided to put them together in one PNG.

I decided to do some (not all of them) Water, Unsure, Sprites,Misc and Object textures PNGs if anybody needs them.

Animating Sheet PNG has all textures for animation (including some new ones i made for fun).

Old water textures were present in files but i didnt put them anywhere, if somebody need them i can put them into Animating Sheet and update the files.

There are 3 zip versions (on my TRSearch) profile: 	
	1. All PNG Textures
	2. All PNG Textures and Photoshop Files (if you want to move textures around or change them slightly)
	3. All PNG Textures, Photoshop Files and all PNG files from Steam Version (including older water textures, Object textures and Sprites that are not present in my PSD/PNG files).

Cant wait your custom games with new textures, enjoy! :)
