
* Pierre Dupont in Tomb Raider Anniversary by Jesus C.Croft *


Now it's time for you to play as Lara Croft's old enemy: Pierre Dupont. Based on his design shown in Tomb Raider Anniversary, 
this package includes the original TRA Pierre Dupont outfit, plus three scream heads you can switch of 
and several and new inventory items.
If you ever wanted to play on the dark side, these outfits are for you, as Pierre Dupont doesn't play for sport anymore.

* Content *

- Pierre Dupont in TRA style.
- New Weapons: Dual 50 Caliber Pistols + Ammo and Dual 50 Caliber Pistols in SIXSHOOTER_ITEM + Ammo.
- New Inventory Items: small and big medipacks, compass, lasersight, binoculars and flares.
- 3 Action heads in LARA_SCREAM slot.
- GUNSHELL, GUN_FLASH, BINOCULAR_GRAPHICS, TARGET_GRAPHICS also included.

* Credits *

- Outfit and all the inventory and ammo items: Meshes created by me. Textures are from Tomb Raider Anniversary and Google images. Additional textures by me.
- Weapons: Reworked meshes from Tomb Raider The Last Revelation. Textures are from Tomb Raider Anniversary. Additional textures by me.
- GUNSHELL, GUN_FLASH, BINOCULAR_GRAPHICS (Reworked by me), TARGET_GRAPHICS also included from Tomb Raider The Last Revelation for you to complete the package.

* You can / you can't *

- You can create new animations for Pierre, even for the flare animation (because he doesn't have a backpack). You also can use Po Yu's Kurtis male animations on these outfits, 
but don't forget to credit him.
- You can add and remap any other weapons (SHOTGUN, CROSSBOW...) or any other items out there (CROWBAR, BURNING_TORCH...) in my outfits, but don't forget to credit ALL the respective authors.
- You can turn Pierre Dupont into an enemy (like a SAS), or into a friendly character (JEAN_YVES, VON_CROY or GUIDE).
- You can alter my meshes and textures ONLY if credit has been given to me. If not, PLEASE don't alter my work in any way without my permission.

* Installation *

1) Open WadMerger, load the wad and copy any file you want to the wad of your choice. Save the new wad, output it and enjoy it!

2) Have in mind that the Revolver weapon is the same as the Dual Pistols. You may ask why, but the reason is to focus
on the use of the same weapon (Pierre's weapons). Let's say you want to use only one of the Caliber Pistols in your adventure, that's why the SIXSHOOTER_ITEM is included.

3) You may need to do some modifications to the Revolver's ammo counting. As we know, the Dual Pistols (in this case the Dual 50 Caliber Pistols)
have unlimited ammo. If the SIXSHOOTER_ITEM is used, you may need to change that, because the Revolver doesn't have unlimited ammo. 
If I'm not mistaken, weapons can be customized via TREP and TRNG.

* Additional notes *

- This is one of my first outfits for Lara. Definitely I had to do it once and for all: I had to do my own outfits. So here you have; after a long and tedious process, I hope you can enjoy them as much as I do and I hope to see levels starring these great characters too.

- I'd like to give thanks to Mr. Nice Guy for the updated Tomb Raider The Last Revelation Lara's Outfit. It was a really helpful studying when creating Pierre Dupont. Thanks to Po Yu too, for his talent that inspired me to create these outfits. And thank you Core Design and Crystal Dynamics for creating and continuing the wonder that is Lara Croft and Tomb Raider.

- If you use anything from this package, please respect all the efforts I've put on it by giving me credit (Also, read the "Credits" section of this Readme). 

- And last but not least, don’t hesitate to contact me. You can do it trough PM on Facebook (I'm Jesús Clares Cruz there. This is the easiest way to contact me), mail: composerfromalmeria@gmail.com and PM on tombraiderforums (I'm Jesus C.Croft there).

Best regards and happy raiding!
